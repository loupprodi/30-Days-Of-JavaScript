//8- Generate a random number between 50 and 100 inclusively.
console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * (100 - 50)) + 50);

console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 255));

//10- Access the 'JavaScript' string characters using a random number.
const word = 'JavaScript';

console.log(word.charAt(random));

//11- Use console.log() and escape characters to print the following pattern.
console.log('1 1 1 1 1\n 2 1 2 4 8\n 3 1 3 9 27\n 4 1 4 16 64\n 5 1 5 25 125');
